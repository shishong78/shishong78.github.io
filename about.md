I am a computational social scientist with research interests in the structure and evolution of large-scale social networks. My research focuses on how people form and maintain social ties and how the broader social, economic and natural environments affect this process. I conduct social network research at a number of thematic intersections, including social contagion, economic sociology, social psychology, the diffusion of innovation, and social movements using empirical data that capture population-scale online social interactions. I welcome interdisciplinary collaboration with researchers from a broad range of backgrounds, from computer scientists, applied mathematicians, social scientists, and management scientists. My research were published in *Science*, *Social Networks*, *PLoS One*, *Lecture Notes in Computer Science*, and *Big Data and Society*.

Currently, I am a tenure-track assistant professor in the Institute for Software Research at Carnegie Mellon University School of Computer Science. Before joining CMU, I was postdoctoral fellow at the University of Michigan and Northwestern University. I received my doctoral degree in sociology at Cornell University.
