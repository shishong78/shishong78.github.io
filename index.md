I am a tenure-track assistant professor in the [Software and Societal Systems Department](https://s3d.cmu.edu) at Carnegie Mellon University's [School of Computer Science](https://www.cs.cmu.edu).

I am currently recruiting creative, curious PhD students interested in the discovery, explanation, and understanding of a broad range of human behavior embedded within today's socio-technical systems, using social network theory, network science, generative AI, and the tools of computational social science. If you are interested in pursuing these questions and acquiring cutting-edge computational tools, consider applying to the [Societal Computing PhD program](https://sc.cs.cmu.edu/) at Carnegie Mellon University.
